# Summary

In the Bayesian analysis of sequence data, priors play an important role. When wrongly selected, the runs may take very long to converge, not converge at all or cause a bias in the inferred trees and model parameters. Selection of proper priors and starting values is crucial and can be a difficult exercise at the start. It is not always easy to pick a proper model of tree generation (tree prior), substitution model, molecular clock model or the prior distribution for an unknown parameter. 

The molecular clock model aims to estimate the substitution rate of the data. It is important to understand under which circumstances to use which model and when molecular calibration works. This will help the investigator determine which estimates of parameters can be trusted and which can not.

In this tutorial, we will explore how priors are selected and how molecular clock calibration works using the H3N2 influenza A data from the flu virus spreading in the USA in 2009.
